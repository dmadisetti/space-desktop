What's the point?
----------
well everone loves games, and it so happens that we (Kerry) made a pretty sweet space shooter. We hought we'd share it with the world.

How do I play?
----------
`git clone https://github.com/dmadisetti/space-desktop`

`cd space-desktop`

`javac Space.java`

`java Space`

Assuming you have the JDK installed and the PATH variable (in Windows) set for javac, the commands will run.

Arrows to move, space to attack

enjoy
